##	Introduction 📖

**Pipex** is a 42 School project designed to replicate the functionality of shell pipelines. Pipelines allow the output of one command to be passed as the input to another command. This project involves creating a program that mimics the behavior of piping multiple commands using redirection.

The goal of **pipex** is to implement the following shell command in C:
```
< infile cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile
```
This means the program will:

1. Read from a file (infile).

2. Pass the output of cmd1 as input to cmd2.

3. Write the output of cmd2 to another file (outfile).

##	Project Requirements 📋

The project focuses on several key concepts:


• **Process creation** using fork().

• **Inter-process communication** using pipes (pipe()).

• **File descriptors management** for redirection using dup2().

• **Execution of commands** using execve().

• Error handling and managing edge cases.

##	Program Usage 💻

To get started, first clone the repository from GitHub and then execute make on the repository.

```
make
```

To execute the pipex program, you can use the following syntax:

```
./pipex infile "cmd1" "cmd2" outfile
```

Where:

• infile: The file from which cmd1 will read its input.

• cmd1: The first command to be executed.

• cmd2: The second command, which will take the output of cmd1 as input.

• outfile: The file where the output of cmd2 will be written.

For example:
```
./pipex input.txt "grep something" "wc -l" output.txt
```

This will:

1. Read from input.txt.

2. Execute grep something on the input.

3. Pass the output of grep to wc -l.

4. Write the result to output.txt.


##	Key Concepts 🧠

1. **Pipes:**

• Pipes are used to connect two processes, allowing one to write data that the other can read.

• A pipe is created using the pipe() system call, which returns two file descriptors: one for reading and one for writing.

2. **Redirection:**

• File redirection is used to replace the standard input/output of a command with files.

• The dup2() function is used to duplicate file descriptors for redirection, ensuring that input/output are connected to the appropriate files or pipes.

3. **Forking and Executing:**

• The program creates child processes using fork(), which then execute the desired commands.

• Each child process executes a command using execve(), and its input/output is redirected appropriately using pipes and file descriptors.

4. **Error Handling:**

• Proper error handling is critical in pipex. If a command fails, the program should display an error message and return the appropriate exit code.

• The program checks for errors such as file access issues or invalid commands.

#	Bonus Features (if applicable) 🏅

• **Compilation:**

```
make bonus
```
Once compiled, you can run pipex using the following syntax:

```
./pipex here_doc EOF cmd1 cmd2 outfile
./pipex infile cmd1 cmd2 cmdn... outfile
```

• **Multiple commands:**

The bonus part of the project supports multiple commands in the pipeline. For example:
```
< infile cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3 > outfile
```

This requires handling a dynamic number of commands, which adds complexity in managing pipes and processes.

• **Here Documents:**

The bonus also includes support for here-documents, which allow input to be provided directly in the command line rather than from a file. This is similar to:
```
<< limiter cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile
```

##	Conclusion ✅

The pipex project serves as an excellent introduction to Unix system calls, process management, and inter-process communication. It offers a deeper understanding of how the shell operates behind the scenes by allowing you to implement piping functionality from scratch.

Throughout this project, I also explored new libraries and learned valuable concepts related to handling pointers, structures, and data. As a result, I applied different techniques for managing memory addresses in various parts of the code. Although I could have handled them uniformly, I opted to experiment with different approaches to reinforce my learning and gain a deeper understanding of memory management. This hands-on experience helped solidify my understanding of these concepts.
